File: .\projecthandler.py
General Description:
This Python script processes files within a specified directory, leveraging the Ollama API to generate descriptions and method analyses for each file. It excludes certain directories and file types (binary files).  The script takes a directory to scan and an output file path as arguments, allowing for customized analysis and results storage.

Methods:
1. def should_exclude(dirpath: str) -> bool
   - Checks if a directory should be excluded from processing based on a predefined list of excluded directory names and patterns within the directory path.
2. def get_file_description(file_path: str, file_content: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
   - Queries the Ollama API to generate a file description in JSON format.  It formats a prompt including file type and content, sends it to Ollama, and attempts to parse the response. Handles potential JSON decode errors.
3. def process_file(file_path: str, output_file: str)
   - Processes a single file: skips large or binary files, reads content, calls get_file_description, and writes results to an output file. Handles file reading errors and attempts to use different encodings.
4. def scan_directory(root_dir: str, output_file: str)
   - Recursively scans a directory using os.walk, excluding specified directories. It then calls process_file for each file encountered.
